# RPi-Pico
Experimenting with the Raspberry Pi Pico.

These experiments typically use the circuitpython Adafruit libraries - see: https://circuitpython.org/libraries for details on how to install and use the libraries. It's probably best to only copy the needed library files to the Pico to save space.

breadboard.FCStd is a FreeCad model of the breadboard/pico holder as seen in the shift register youtube video: https://youtu.be/eDOK4IY3GXE. It uses fricton to hold the breadboard and pico in place. It is designed to have the pico upside down with the power pin closest to the breadboard. One of the cutouts for the bumps on the side of the breadboard is not quite aligned but with a bit of force the breadboard fits and holds tight. The long sides of the pico holder could be a gnats wisker closer for a little more friction but not too bad as is.
