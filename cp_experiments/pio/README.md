#  Experiments with the Programmable I/O  (PIO)

The files `blink_mod.py`, `hello_mod.py` and `led_brightness_mod.py` are small modifications of the example programs in https://learn.adafruit.com/intro-to-rp2040-pio-with-circuitpython/overview . The description of the code on this site is well worth a read.
I have added extra comments to help in my understanding of what's going on.
